               <p>
                   Hello again.</p>
               <p>So for this post I thought I might try an idea which a friend gave me, which is kind of like an extension of the introduction I gave last week and also a bit of introspection into who we all really are. </p>
              <p>
                  Basically, my friend's idea was that I should go on thoughtquestions.com and pick out a few of the more meaningful questions and have a go at answering them, as a way to tell you more about myself besides the obvious things, and cliches aside, I thought it was a pretty good idea. 
              </p>
              <p>I tried to pick the more descriptive ones and so I ended up with these questions and answers. I hope this gives you a better idea of what kind of person I am:

</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>'What's one thing you have never been good at?'
                  </strong></p>
<p>Singing, even though I sing wayyy too much. I’ve never critically analysed myself, but I’m pretty sure I’m somewhere between tone deaf and screeching cat. It’s a shame cause I really do love music, but on the bright side, noise cancelling headphones at least give me the imagination that I can sing as well as the artist. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>'Who in your life do you wish you had met sooner?'
</strong></p>
              <p>
This is a tougher one, since I’ve met so many great people that I love spending time with, and the obvious answer may be to go to my girlfriend, but I feel I met her at just the right time (If I don’t blog next week, look up gone girl and call 999). I would probably say it would be a best friend I had when I was 18, called Rachel. We’re no longer friends now because of circumstance, but meeting her and losing her as a friend gave me a big appreciation for how regretful some of my actions can be. It taught me that you shouldn’t do bad things not because it hurts someone (because sometimes people deserve it), but because of the regret you feel later on in life, very little compares to that feeling. Overall, she made me a much more grateful person, so if you’re out there Rachel, thank you.              </p>
              <p><strong>'What’s your favourite song and why?'
</strong></p>
              <p>
                  So many songs, and so many lyrics, but I’d probably go with ‘If The House Burns Down Tonight’ by Switchfoot. The song is about realising that the most important things in life are the things which you love. That those are the things worth fighting for, and with those, in the moments of consequence, the rest can burn and it won’t matter. Plus it’s an amazing rock song.
              </p>
               <p><strong>What's something you always say 'NO' to?</strong></p>
               <p>A tricky one for sure. Walnuts, I think, like they're the most tasteless nut I've ever tasted, why do we even use them?</p>
               <p><strong>What's something you've grown to appreciate as you've grown older?</strong></p>
               <p>Responsibility, and it's relevance towards parenthood. I had an unenjoyable youth, and I despised my parents, and family for a long time, and whilst there are things which still linger on the mind, you start to realise that everyone has their own life, full of stress, responsiblity and failure. Obviously, naivety and thoughtlessness isn't an excuse, but I know how some situations can make you completely careless and barren.
               
               <p><strong>What was your first job title?</strong></p>
               
               <p>Technically, a stenographer. I still do this freelance, but much less frequently nowadays. Stenography for those who don't know is just typing transcripts of meetings/audio files. I type at 140+ WPM (I've had a lot of fun on typeracer) so the hourly pay actually works out to be pretty efficient for me. I will say though, if you type fast, don't think about doing this long term, it really messes with your wrists and fingers typing that fast for long periods.</p>
               
              <p><strong>'What’s one thought provoking quote that motivates you?'
</strong></p>
             <p>
                 This is a bit of a long one, but I think it’s as golden as they come:
                 <blockquote>"The pathway to completion as a human being is through the embodiment of the monster. You can’t be a good person until you discover your capacity for evil. Not by acting it out in the world, but by understanding it and bringing it under your control. You see, there’s a big difference between someone who is naive and is a ‘good person’— they’re a good person because they can’t not be. They’re like a domesticated house cat. They don’t even have the capacity to be bad. There’s no morality in that. The morality comes when you’re a monster, and you can control it."
                 <cite>Jordan Peterson</cite></blockquote>
                 The quote is pretty self-explanatory. You can’t find out how good you are as a person until you accept your darker shades and habits. So many people try and relent and refute that they’re a bad person because admitting it doesn’t align with our own or society’s motives, but I don’t think self-denial is a way to improve. We’re more than just our past mistakes.
             </p>
             <p>
                 <strong>'What never fails to capture your attention?'</strong>
             </p>
             <p>Girls in mini skirts.</p>
             <p><strong>'What's something you enjoy making or building from scratch?'
</strong></p>
             <p>
                 Well, designing is a funny thing.
           </p>
           <p>
I’m a mediocre drawer on my best days and I’m not too bad with sketches (of buildings) but it’s not a secret that you typically tend to like things which you’re good at, or have the ability to be good at.</p>
<p>
Now, I wouldn’t say I’m fantastic at it, but relatively speaking to myself, I’d say I’m pretty good with designing websites, and I enjoy it a lot. I’ve been doing web design for around 4 years now, mostly for other people, and it pays pretty well, but usually my clients just want what some other company has, so it’s pretty cut and dry. Designing this website was really fun though. Thinking about the structure and layout in the shower, designing different components at work (secretly), it’s just been a lot of fun planning.
           </p>
           <p>So, this website is my answer</p>
           <p>That’s all for this post, it was a bit of a long one and a lot of fun too. Next week should be another one like this, as in getting to know me, and will be the last of them before I start getting into the concrete blog stuff. I hope you enjoyed this and if you’ve got any other ‘thought provoking’ questions you want to know about me, please feel free to leave a comment. </p>
Until next time, 
<br>
