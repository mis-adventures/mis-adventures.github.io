               <h4>Not So Humble Beginnings</h4>

               <p>
                   Hello and welcome to my blog. I'm Majed Ghali, and since this is my first blog post I figure I should probably introduce myself and establish some basic notions from the get-go. Partly for you, mostly for me so I don't stray too far. 
Now, to do that let's all take a trip down memory lane straight into primary school, where we know the best way to start a story is with Why, What, When, Who and Where. </p>
               <p><strong>Why</strong></p>
              <p>
                  I'll start by saying I'm not big into social media, I think it's an intrusion on a lot of privacy (ironic then, that I'm making this blog) and it paints things ever-green. Green sucks, and that's why I'm at this doorstep. I feel it's a way of pronouncing my thoughts about things in a white light, embracing all aspects, so the sucky times and the euphoric moments. I'll be publishing a variety of different posts as I like to be involved with a diverse group of things so I don't get bored. As for why the whole website, well, the website is mostly me experimenting and expanding upon my HTML skills and I thought this entire idea of a creative exhibition was really cool. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>What</strong></p>
              <p>
                  For the most part you can expect: 
<br><br>
Running, Cycling, Swimming (Lots) 
<br>Transport Engineering Waffle 
<br>Pseudo-Inspirational Stuff 
<br>Music 
<br>Food 
<br>Travelling (Lots of Photos) 
<br>
Tech 
<br>
(Some Humor?) 
<br><br>
In that order, likely. I'll be honest now and say if you're looking for a blog about a certain topic, like motivational life lessons or fast rapids water rafting, this probably isn't it, this aims to be more of a cross between the obligation (?) of a blog and the personal nature of a journal mixed in with my own deceptively dark sense of humor. I expect it's going to be very mundane and boring at times. Whilst it may sound very selfish, this is more for me than it is for anybody reading. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>When</strong></p>
              <p>
                  When is honestly whenever it ends up working. I won't make promises about my schedule because it's always hectic but you can expect a standard blog post at least every two weeks, although I hope to make them more frequent than that. Travel blogs will be much less frequent because travelling is hard to fit around things, and race reports a little less frequently than that for the next year or so just due to the nature of the knee problem and ankle impingement I've recently suffered
              </p>
              <p><strong>Who &amp; Where</strong></p>
              <p>
                  Now the fun part. So a little introduction to myself would be that I'm currently a 20-year old postgraduate student doing a masters degree in transport engineering at Leeds University in the UK. I took this year off on temporary leave due to a series of injuries over the past twelve months (two stress fractures, peroneal tendinopathy, achilles bursitis, medial plica syndrome and a partial ACL reconstruction, sucks, I know), but I'll be starting again in September and so the next 5 months look to be a lot of exploration and adventure seeking, which I plan to all document in this blog. I love triathlon (a bit too much you could say), pretty much all types of music (bar classical and mumble rap, I mean, c'mon) but especially alternative-rock-esque genres, so think Fall Out Boy, The Maine and Switchfoot, and I'm also very big on the whole autonomous integration into our transport network and actually did my bachelor degree's dissertation on the feasibility of such a proposal. 
<br><br>
I'll be candid and say my morals are questionable at best and completely non-existent most of the time. 
<br><br>
And Where? Right here. This blog. 
<br><br>
Lastly, in terms of the website, a lot of it is still under construction, so if you find a faulty link or a weird media screen, please contact me. Also, there is no search bar and that is by design, you can use the archives I've created which are found at the bottom of the page.
<br><br>
I think that concludes the introduction, and so if you find any of this interesting, stay tuned, it's going to be a long road. 
<br><br>
Until next time,
<br> 
Majed
