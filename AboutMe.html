                   I was born in 1998 and grew up in York in the UK, but both of my parents are Lebanese and moved here some 7 years before my birth. At 13 years old my Dad moved to Qatar for work and the family moved to Egypt because we had ties and properties there. 13-17 was spent in Cairo, finishing my IGCSEs and A-Levels, before moving back to the UK and going to the University of Sheffield to get my bachelor’s degree in civil engineering which I attained last year. I’m now at the University of Leeds getting my masters of science in transport engineering whilst working part time.

              <p>
                 That's the boring stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
I’m a pretty simple person at heart; I’m a bit of a perfectionist, I prefer a minimalistic lifestyle and I do what I love when I can and I fight for it when I can’t.<br>              
I like a wide variety of things, as most people do. I’m very much in love with triathlon, and of course, I love engineering, and these two things take up most of my time, but the thing is, both engineering and triathlon are mostly rigid; you train, you do the calcs and you get the results, which is great for my trust issues, but I’ll admit it does get tedious at times.<br>We are more than one dimensional after all.<br>
This website then, is aimed to help me find a balance in my life and to be a place to explore and share some of my more creative thoughts that I seldom get to express elsewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So let's picture a cube of creativity and define these dimensions.
              </p>
              <p>This website will mainly cover three of my creative interests. The first, is writing. I love to write (and read for that matter). I've been journalling heavily since I was about 15 as a form of control and catharsis. I kind of admire literature; the connotations of words, the veiled meanings that can be detected in sentence structure and ultimately the perfection which can only be found in make believe.<br>
Most of my writing is going to be done in the form of blog posts, so weekly summations, travel journals and race reports. I really enjoy writing short stories too, and with time (and a few late night drinks), I hope to upload some of them and perhaps start a series, but don't hold your breath just yet.</p>
              <p>Next is photography. Ah, photography.<br>For a while I thought this entire skillset and in turn profession was a joke, but I’ve since found a lot of intricacy and enjoyment in photos. I use a Nikon D3500 as my main camera and an iPhone SE in surprise situations, and I mostly use Photoshop CS6 for post-processing.
              I've only been doing photography seriously for a year so this is definitely my youngest interest and thus my weakest. Most of my photos will be featured in the travel blogs I cover, since getting out for good photos when not on holiday is difficult. I like to experiment with different kinds of photography, and I appreciate most forms, but truthfully I'm not a big fan of portrait photography; I think a scene speaks louder without people present.
              </p>
              <p>Lastly, music. A bit of an odd one, since I have no idea how to formally fit it into this website. Regardless, music has a special place in my heart. I play piano (a lot nowadays), and guitar, but truthfully I find listening so much more enjoyable than playing. Music has helped me through my toughest moments, and I’ll refrain from being melodramatic and saying I wouldn’t be here without some song, but they’ve definitely eased my pain at times and fuelled my inspirations at others. Everyone deserves to be without pain, and I do find happiness in helping others, but for me at least, I've found when I'm at my lowest, I prefer to be completely alone with only my mind and my interpretations of songs. So sharing some undiscovered music.</p>
              
              <p>That concludes it. I hope you find amusement in some of the things this website has to offer and if you have any questions or regards, be that praise, criticism or a constructive comment, please feel free to contact me.</p>
              
              <p>Finally, if you want a touch more information about me, I suggest reading my first three blog posts where I give a bit more insight into my situation, hobbies and preferences.</p>

              <p>P.S. I’m a big believer in taking pictures for the moment, so here’s me at my laptop working on this exact page at 2am right now. I am very tired.</p>
